# Car Price Prediction Using XGBoost

## Introduction
We implemented an XGBoost regression model to predict car prices. The model was trained and evaluated using cross-validation to ensure its robustness and accuracy.

## Model Configuration

### 1. Model Initialization
We initialized the XGBoost model with the following parameters:

- `tree_method="hist"`: This specifies the histogram-based algorithm. The histogram algorithm is efficient for large datasets as it reduces the computation time by grouping continuous features into discrete bins.
- `n_estimators=1000`: This sets the number of boosting rounds to 1000. Boosting is an iterative process where the model learns from previous errors, and more rounds can improve model performance.

```python
import xgboost as xgb

model = xgb.XGBRegressor(tree_method="hist", n_estimators=1000)
```
